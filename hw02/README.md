# README: hw02

Homework 2 explores Gapminder and uses dplyr. Several figure types are tried and some questions are solved in various ways, which enhances my understanding of R programming. I went through many materials and tried many new things which were not covered in lectures yet.

This is the folder for STAT 545A Homework 2, which includes two files, RMD and MD.
