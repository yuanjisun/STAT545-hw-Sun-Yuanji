Homework 3 explores Gapminder and uses dplyr and ggplot2. The goal is to manipulate and explore a dataset with the dplyr package, complemented by visualizations made with ggplot2.

I finished all questions and did much beyond the requirement, including making complex figures with different fiture types, formating all tables, putting figures and tables side by side, setting up a linear regression model and making a prediction, as well as other new skills.

Detailed information about this homework, such as problems I ran into, useful resources, are included in the file below.

This is the folder for STAT 545A Homework 3, which includes two files, RMD and HTML.

[Link to RMD file](https://github.com/yuanjisun/STAT545-hw-Sun-Yuanji/blob/master/hw03/hw03.Rmd)

[Link to HTML file (DOWNLOAD first)](https://github.com/yuanjisun/STAT545-hw-Sun-Yuanji/blob/master/hw03/hw03.html)

MD file is not generated in this homework because HTML codes do not work in MD file and it will look quite messy.

__Note__

In order to put figures and tables side by side, HTML is rendered instead of MD file. Since HTML cannot be displayed in GitHub properly and my HTML file is too large to be opened in GitHub website, please download the file and open it using a browser.
