Homework 3 explores Gapminder and uses dplyr and ggplot2. The goal is to manipulate and explore a dataset with the dplyr package, complemented by visualizations made with ggplot2.

I finished all questions and did much beyond the requirement, including making complex figures, formating all tables, putting figures and tables side by side, setting up a linear regression model and making a prediction, as well as other new skills.

Detailed information about this homework, such as problems I ran into, useful resources, are included in the file below.

This is the folder for STAT 545A Homework 3, which includes two files, RMD and MD.
