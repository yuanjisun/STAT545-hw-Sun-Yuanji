This is the folder for STAT 545A Homework 5, which includes two files, RMD and MD.

[Link to RMD file](https://github.com/yuanjisun/STAT545-hw-Sun-Yuanji/blob/master/hw05/hw05.Rmd)

The goals for this homework are:

- Reorder a factor in a principled way based on the data and demonstrate the effect in arranged data and in figures.
- Improve a figure (or make one from scratch), using new knowledge, e.g., control the color scheme, use factor levels, smoother mechanics.
- Implement visualization design principles.
- Write some data to file and load it back into R. E.g., save a plot to file and include it in a R Markdown report via `![Alt text](/path/to/img.png)`.
- Organise your github, to celebrate the completion of STAT 545 and/or to prepare for the glorious future of STAT 547.
