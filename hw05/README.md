There are .csv, .png, .pdf and .xls files in this folder, which are generated by rendering RMD file. They are exported from the table and figure.

__The goals for this homework are__

- Reorder a factor in a principled way based on the data and demonstrate the effect in arranged data and in figures.
- Improve a figure (or make one from scratch), using new knowledge, e.g., control the color scheme, use factor levels, smoother mechanics.
- Implement visualization design principles.
- Write some data to file and load it back into R. E.g., save a plot to file and include it in a R Markdown report via `![Alt text](/path/to/img.png)`.
- Organise your github, to celebrate the completion of STAT 545 and/or to prepare for the glorious future of STAT 547.
